# Assignment-1
Answer to 

Question 1:

A class is a user-defined type provided to represent
a concept in the code of a program.It combines data reprsentation
and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package.

Question 2:

An Abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all kinds of objects and thus provide
crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective of the viewer.

Encapsulation is the process of compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitute it's structure and behavior,
encapsulation serves to separate the contractual interface of an abstraction and it's implementation.

Data hiding means that data is concealed within a
class so that it cannot be accessed mistakenly by functions outside the class. The primary
mechanism for hiding data is to put it in a class and make it private. Private data or functions
can only be accessed from within the class. Public data or functions, on the other hand, are
accessible from outside the class.

Question 3: 

An object is an instance of a class

Question 4:

the data within a class is private and the functions are public. This is a result of the
way classes are used. The data is hidden so it will be safe from accidental manipulation, while
the functions that operate on the data are public so they can be accessed from outside the class.

Question 5:  answered inside the class of example 1



Question 6:

A constructor is a member function that is executed automatically whenever an object is created.
A destructor has the same name as the constructor (which is the same as the class name) but is preceded by
a tilde. It is called automatically when an object is destroyed.

Question 7: answered inside the class of example 1



Question 8:

A default constructor is a constructor that is used to create an object when you don't provide explicit intialization values.
Because the programmer may forget to initialize the object after creating
it. It’s more reliable and convenient, especially when there are a great many objects of a given
class, to cause each object to initialize itself when it’s created.
